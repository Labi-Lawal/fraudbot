# chatbot
A bot for detecting fraud attempt.
This project was originally created by https://ireoluwaadedugbe.com and modified by https://github.com/Labi-Lawal/.
This version contains the intelligence in the most basic form with a simple Web UI to interact with the bot.
It is built with NodeJS (JavaScript), Html and CSS.
The bot determines if you are a fraudster or not based on the texts you send to it,
an array of words has been saved and would check through the user's text.... if it finds any of the saved words, 
it alerts and tags the person as a fraudster.

In the future version, i'm planning to add an additional system to allow people report and submit new words to the database  
so the intelligence grows based on the amount of people that use it.
